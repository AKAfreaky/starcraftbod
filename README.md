Behaviour oriented design of a StarCraft AI
=================

This is the python/jython side of my modifications to Simon Davies' StarCraft AI.

It was created using Behaviour Oriented Design it is run by jyPOSH which calls python code, 
which then calls Java code built upon JNIBWAPI, which is a JNI interface into BWAPI,
which finally interfaces into StarCraft (and is built in C++)

Installation/running instructions can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/abode-star/wiki/StarCraftAIShowcase
